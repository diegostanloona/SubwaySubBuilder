Project I made for a company technical interview. It's a sandwich builder in a redesigned Subway webpage. It only features the frontend without the payment process since the test just asked me for 3 different views. All assets except for the builder images were taken from Subway official website, and none of them belong to me. This project does not attempt to show Subway and its services as mine.
